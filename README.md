# DBMS-Retail-Store-Project

Final group project for COMP 3753 (Database Management Systems) developed through the term in a group of three teammates.

The project goal was to create a relational database with a RESTful API for a retail store using SQL with MySQL, PHP for the web API, and AMPPS to host the web API. Before implementation the initial database schema was created with an ER diagram, then once implemented the final schema was found through reverse engineering the current state of the database in MySQL.

Through the API you can query names of customers, and orders by status and date.
